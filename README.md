## History

For some time now, I started this personal project, looking for a way to simplify and save time in the construction of the UI for Kontakt, as it took me longer to create the interface than to develop the operational logic, and that was somewhat troubling to me.

Gradually, I added features, and as I used it, more ideas were born which I would implement in my free time. There are still details to iron out, but the bulk of it is done, and I feel quite satisfied.

Initially, there was no intention of distributing the application, I didn't even know if it would reach the level it has now. But I've realized that it has a lot of potential and that likely many people are now in the position I was in a while ago, looking for a way to save time, which is incredibly valuable today.

### Custom Controls
- Allows importing animated controls in png image format. This is the standard format we all know.
- Allows importing animated controls in svg image format, which have a special feature: they can be pre-configured before importing by editing the svg attributes, such as changing colors in objects. This makes it easier to seamlessly blend the controls with the current design, without having to create a new image.
- Animated controls are displayed normally in the editor, exactly as they appear in Kontakt, without the need to cut or modify the images. If there is any color adjustment in the case of svg, the application will automatically create the new image with the new colors and size.

### Image panel
- Allows viewing previously imported animated controls, organized by category. It also displays the type, size, and other properties of each image.

### Fonts panel
- Allows viewing custom-generated fonts, organized by name. It also displays the size and other properties of each font.

### Nka editor panel
- Enables easy creation, viewing, and editing of presets.

### KSP Script Editor Panel
- Facilitates simple and organized coding, with each callback predefined for quick access. Control callbacks are generated automatically.

### Control Panel
- Allows viewing, hiding, moving, dragging, deleting, and selecting all controls, enabling easy organization.

### Properties panel
- Enables editing of all control properties, including some additional properties that were only available through KSP Script, further facilitating customization.

### Options Panel Svg
- This panel displays editable options for the svg control, such as colors and size.

### Custom Font Generator
- With the included custom font generator, no external tool is necessary. It generates and displays in real time directly on the controls, while adjusting size, color, and style.

### Project file
- Easily saves and loads projects in a single file, saving time in gathering all resources like images, nka, scripts, etc. Everything is embedded in the single project file.
Easy switch from one project to another.

### Viewing in Kontakt
- Sends with a click and instantly tests your project in Kontakt. All files are automatically sent to the Kontakt resource directory.
